# Prompt: Generate a Fully Functional Browser-Based Operating System (WebOS)

Generate a **single HTML file** for a professional, fully functional, browser-based operating system called **WebOS**, built with advanced features and modern design principles.  
The file must include **all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js** in one modular, well-documented structure.

## ‚úÖ Current Scope (As Built) ‚Äî 2025-09-25

This section summarizes the functionality currently implemented in `webos-enhanced.html` and recent architectural decisions. The original PRD below remains our roadmap.

### Implemented
- Desktop environment with menu bar, notifications, clock, dock, and Start menu
- Window manager: open/focus/minimize/maximize/move/resize with z-index management
- Virtual File System persisted in `localStorage` with basic operations (create/read/write/move/copy/delete, search)
- Built-in apps: `ToastSearcher` (file explorer), `Web Navigator` (embedded browser with proxy toggle), `Text Studio` (editor), `Terminal` (toy shell), `Media Player`, `Image Viewer`, `System Settings`, `Task Command`
- App catalog, categories, Start menu with search, and category management
- PWA: static `manifest.json` linked in `<head>`, service worker `sw.js` for offline cache
- Background particles implemented with Canvas (Three.js optional)
- New Start button icon (grid SVG) in taskbar
- AI Assistant app with safe automations
  - Open apps and URLs via `/open` and `/openurl`
  - File search `/search`, read `/read` (text only, size capped)
  - Write `/write` and `/append` restricted to `/Documents` and `/Downloads`, with confirmation modal
  - OpenAI‚Äëcompatible chat via configurable Base URL / Model / API key, saved in `webos.ai.settings.v1`

### Not Yet Implemented (Roadmap from PRD)
- Multi-user login, App Store, virtual desktops, thumbnails on hover, full developer tools, advanced terminal command set, widgets suite, multi-language, auto-update, etc.

### Deviations/Decisions
- Particles use a Canvas implementation for performance and simplicity; Three.js may be reintroduced later if needed
- Static manifest is the single source of truth; dynamic Blob manifest injection has been removed to avoid conflicts
- Desktop icons are hidden by default for a clean look; can be re-enabled via CSS or future Settings toggle
